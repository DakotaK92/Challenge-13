## Challenge 13 - E-commerce Back End

## Description
With this challenge I was tasked to update a functional Express API by making a Post, Put and Delete requests using Insomnia. When Insomnia is involked, the routes with new the infomation of Tags, Categories and Products is displayed. 

When I "Get" information from the Tag, i'm given a function of everything inside the Tag branch. When I "Post" new information to Category, i'm adding new info to my database. When I "Put" a change into a old post, i'm then given a new update to my database. Lastly, I can delete data that is no longer needed.
